Hi there. I'd like to build a thing: 1. It's a static website that I can host somewhere like github pages. 2. I want to be able to wear a QR code that refers to it. 3. And then I want the website to do browser-side pose estimation (or face tracking, or QR code alignment, gimme options) that allows for simple "overlay over the face" or "overlay over the person" rendering. 4. I'd like to be able to do a few things, like laying a sprite over the person, possibly an animated cutout of rick astley from never gonna give you up (I can do the alpha cutting and image editing), possibly a 3D model that follows a skeleton boning (some stock assets would be nice.. basic 3D shit). 5. remember, it needs to be statically hostable. It's all client side. I'd like it to work with phones, both Android and iOS. Figure out what is compatible with the broad set of devices. 6. And let's have some option for a UI for changing costumes, something as simple as an on-screen button over the camera preview that randomly swaps would be fine.... or a selector carousel at the bottom. Gimme options. I'm going to code this up with claude code, so I'll want some sort of execution play markdown. Go forth. Let's make it work for all detected faces in frame (up to 10 or something) so we can make everyone look he same.
